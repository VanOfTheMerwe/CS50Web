# CS50 Web
## Web Development:
This course was about the teaching me the correct way of creating dynamic websites. Implementing functionality into my web pages to make them a lot more usefull than I could make with just plain old HTML, JavaScript and CSS. 
## About the course:
The course is from Harvard and was presented by Brian Yu. 
In this course I used Django to create the web pages. Django is used to implement Python code into the web pages. 
One thing I learned is that using Django can be a challenge if you don't know what you are doing. So please read. Always read.
